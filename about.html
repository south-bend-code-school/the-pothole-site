     <h2 id="whystart"> Why We Started </h2>
     <p href><h4 id="start">
      We're the South Bend Pothole Association gang. As kids, every winter we always hear the same thing, "The potholes are horrible this year". So we decided to do something about it. This website allows you to pin the exact location of potholes in South Bend. You can also add a pothole that we may have missed. It will hopefully let the city realize where the potholes are, and they will be able to fix them faster. We hope that this will help the community in a way in which everyone can contribute. We also thought that this would be a neat little project we could each work on while at the same time, helping others.
